[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/cinderblock/node-userid/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/cinderblock/node-userid?branch=master)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install userid
# Or, alternatively, directly from github:
$ npm install cinderblock/node-userid
```

This relies on GNU `getgrname` and `getgrid`.
Works on POSIX systems only.
This package is not useful on Windows.

## Usage

### Example

```js
var userid = require("userid");

// get user id
console.log("root's uid is:", userid.uid("root"));

// get group id
console.log("wheel's gid is:", userid.gid("wheel"));

// get user name
console.log("uid 0 name is:", userid.username(0));

// get group name
console.log("gid 0 name is:", userid.groupname(0));
```

## History

This package was originally created by [Jen Andre](https://github.com/jandre/node-userid) <jandre@gmail.com>.

In 2019, it was, unfortunately, missing updates that are required to run on the latest versions of Node.js.

Since Jen has not responded to any attempts at contact, I requested that Npm transfer the package so that I might keep it maintained.

Version 1.0.0 switched to N-API, the forward compatible interface that should be, all around, much nicer moving forward.
It also signals the change to using Github Actions to run all our full coverage tests on all supported platforms.

## License

The license, when the package was created, had some mix of GLPv3 and Public Domain.

Since the main source code has always been Public Domain, I'm going to keep it that way.
I've also explicitly extended it to the rest of the main (published) source code.

Event though Jen's before last commit (ba665c45d958982ff5aa0d482741a2955a4de8c4) changed the license in one location to MIT,
the tests, build files, and other scripts (especially those by other contributors) were added under the GPLv3.
I'm therefore inclined to think it's better to not hold to that final license change.

Going forward, all published source code (the part that you use as a user of this package) will be all **Public Domain**.
The rest of this package will stay **GPLv3**.
